# Solubility-Prediction-using-the-Delany-Dataset
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict aqueous solubility of chemical compounds using the Delany Solubility with Descriptors dataset.
The goal is to transform raw molecular descriptor data into a usable format, train a prediction model, and evaluate its performance — completing an end-to-end machine learning workflow.

The project demonstrates the entire ML pipeline, including preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and documentation of key decisions.

Dataset

Source: Delany Solubility with Descriptors dataset
Format: CSV file
Description:
This dataset contains molecular descriptors and experimentally measured solubility values for a variety of chemical compounds. Each record includes numeric features representing chemical structure/behavior and a target column representing solubility.
